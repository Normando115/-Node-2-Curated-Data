# Food Randomizer
This randomizer was made with the intent of helping me decide what meals I want to make for myself whenever I run out of food and need to go grocery shopping. I chose to make it a wheel because I think that its not fun to just have a randomizer where you just click a button and you instantly get a random output. That is why I made a wheel that shows its hand moving and pointing towards something so you can see it in action. This project was very challenging for me since there was a lot of things I didn't understand about the logic behind a spinner wheel, but I'm glad I chose to to do it and I'm satisfied with the results I ended up with.
